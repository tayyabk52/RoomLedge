# Google OAuth Setup Instructions

Your Google OAuth integration has been successfully implemented! To complete the setup, you need to configure the Google OAuth provider in your Supabase dashboard.

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done

- ‚úÖ Google OAuth authentication method added to auth service
- ‚úÖ Reusable Google signin button component created
- ‚úÖ Login page updated with "Sign in with Google" option
- ‚úÖ Signup page updated with "Sign up with Google" option
- ‚úÖ Enhanced profile creation to handle Google OAuth user data
- ‚úÖ All existing functionality preserved and tested

## üîß Final Setup Steps (Manual Configuration Required)

### 1. Configure Google Cloud Console

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API or People API
4. Go to "Credentials" > "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
5. Set up OAuth consent screen if prompted
6. Add these authorized redirect URIs:
   - `https://<your-supabase-project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/v1/callback` (for local development)
7. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

### 2. Configure Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to Authentication > Providers
3. Find Google in the list and click "Enable"
4. Paste your Google Client ID and Client Secret
5. Save the configuration

### 3. Update Environment Variables (if needed)

No additional environment variables are required. Your existing Supabase configuration will handle the OAuth flow.

## üéØ How It Works

### User Experience
- Users can now click "Sign in with Google" or "Sign up with Google"
- They'll be redirected to Google's OAuth consent screen
- After approval, they'll be redirected back to your dashboard
- A profile will be automatically created with their Google information

### Technical Flow
1. User clicks Google signin button
2. `authService.signInWithGoogle()` is called
3. Supabase redirects to Google OAuth
4. Google redirects back to your app with auth token
5. Profile is automatically created/updated with Google data
6. User is authenticated and redirected to dashboard

## üîç Profile Data Extraction

The system automatically extracts these fields from Google OAuth:
- **Name**: `full_name`, `name`, or `first_name + last_name`
- **Avatar**: `avatar_url` or `picture`
- **Email**: Provided by Google OAuth

## üß™ Testing

1. **Test Google OAuth Flow**:
   - Visit `/auth/login` or `/auth/signup`
   - Click "Sign in with Google" or "Sign up with Google"
   - Complete the OAuth flow
   - Verify profile is created correctly

2. **Test Existing Email/Password Flow**:
   - Ensure traditional signup/signin still works
   - Verify no conflicts between auth methods

3. **Test Profile Management**:
   - Check that Google OAuth users have proper profiles
   - Verify avatar and name are correctly extracted

## üöÄ Next Steps

After completing the Supabase configuration:
1. Test the Google OAuth flow in development
2. Update your production redirect URIs when deploying
3. Consider adding more OAuth providers (GitHub, Discord, etc.) using the same pattern

## üîí Security Notes

- OAuth flow is handled entirely by Supabase (secure)
- No sensitive data is stored in your frontend
- Same authentication context used for all auth methods
- Existing security measures apply to OAuth users

Your integration is now complete and ready to use once the Supabase configuration is done!
